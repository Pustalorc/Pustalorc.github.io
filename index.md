<h1>Public Programs/Plugins/Libraries</h1>

[Unturned Server Manager](/UnturnedServerManager/) - Main and biggest program ever done by me. Currently on version 3.0.1.4. Works around the game "unturned" and allows the user to host servers with the program. - Working on 3.1 [here](https://github.com/persiafighter/UnturnedServerManager/tree/Beta-3.1), help is appreciated at any time.

[Rocket Rules](/Rocket-Rules/) - Plugin for the game "unturned". Works with a few simple mathematical functions. In a nutshell, it displays rules to player on join or when they do /rules.

[Duty](https://github.com/Ev1dentFir3/Duty) - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell, it gives superadmin powers to the player that does /duty. Disclaimer: I did NOT develop this one, only fixed up the code and re-uploaded it to rocketmod.

[Rocket IP](https://github.com/persiafighter/Rocket-IP) - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell, it gets the IP of a player who is currently connected to your server.

[Fake Gambling - Crash](https://github.com/persiafighter/FakeGambling-Crash) - Very simple Gambling type game. Uses a cryptography method for the "randomness".

[Unturned Downloader](https://github.com/persiafighter/unturned-downloader) - A standalone module that Unturned Server Manager uses.

[RPG - (OLD Page)](http://rpg-v2.boards.net/) -- [RPG - (Github Page)](https://github.com/persiafighter/RPG) - A very old game that I programmed in VBS. It was never finnished, but it worked more or less like a game, including save states, 1 single exit point (since I didn't know where else to add them), a "story", and a flow of direction. Project is abandoned.

<h1>Custom Or Private Programs/Plugins</h1>

[<span style="color:red">Ask [Ikatzuki](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ikatzuki1/) for a copy</span>] - Reputation Loadout - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell, it will give a loadout/kit to a player after respawn when the player has a specific reputation. Also has the ability to give a Rank to a player after a few set of kills.

[<span style="color:green">Free</span>] - Tempban - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell it adds the command /tempban to be able to ban temporarily a player. Currently, when using rocketmod, "/ban player/reason/time" causes/has problems and is kind of unstable.

[<span style="color:green">Free</span>] - Command Only Regions - Edit to regions, adds the ability to switch to a different group when entering and leaving a region.

[<span style="color:yellow">5€</span>] - MaxVehicles - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell blocks players from spawning more than a maximum number of vehicles. Ie: it limits how many vehicles can exist in the map.

[<span style="color:yellow">20€</span>] - AutoUpdate - Plugin for unturned. In a nutshell it will automatically shutdown the server with a custom delay, warn everyone in the server that there's an update and then update the entire server.
