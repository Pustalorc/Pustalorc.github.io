<h1>Programs</h1>

[Decryptor](https://github.com/persiafighter/d3crypt0r) - Program that will "decrypt" a message encrypted with the Encryptor program by bruteforcing the characters to get the values (due to this bruteforce, some keys & messages might have more than 1 result).

Project is abandoned.
